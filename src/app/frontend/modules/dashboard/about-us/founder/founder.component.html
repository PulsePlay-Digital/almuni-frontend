                        a strong will power, the environment is never a limiting factor. Prof. Bala was one such
                        individual who has fought against the environmental factors to craft a fortune for himself. Born
                        in the iron grip of poverty education was a scarce commodity to come by. To make a place for
                        himself in the world, he left the comforts of a protected family life and joined an orphanage
                        and completed his education up to high school. He then joined the Indian Army as a Sepoy and
                        retired as a Subedar after a service of 28 years. While wearing the uniform, he acquired three
                        post-graduate degrees with flying colors.
