                    <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-2">India is going through an Industrial Revolution. Many
                        multinationals, transnational & global companies are investing in the Indian economy and Indian
                        companies are going global. In the globalised business environment demand for well trained work
                        force is increasing. Not withstanding the upheavals in the global market, India is still poised
                        to keep her growing phase as can be seen in the economic growth rate compared to the other
                        countries in the World. Right person to the right job with right attitude is the demand of the
                        industry.</p>

                    <h3>Sri Balaji Society, Pune functions like a Corporate Entity</h3>
                    <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-2">Sri Balaji Society, Pune/ Management institutes/ Colleges are
                        run on the lines of a corporate
                        entity. The Directors of the Management Institutes function like CEO’s. Students are treated as
                        'Student Managers' with due respect, love, concern, dignity and authority. Those who perform are
                        rewarded. Delinquent students are dealt with disciplinarily. Discipline, Dedication and
                        Determination are our ‘Mantras’. The ability to perform and grow towards a definite career in
                        any part of the country are the qualities expected from every 'Student Manager'. Here 'Time' is
                        treated as the most precious resource. Our classes generally commence at early morning hours say
                        08:00 am or 09:00 am and may go on even beyond 07:00 pm with minimum breaks. We also hold late
                        night classes/examinations as and when required.</p>

                        Graduate and
                        rare personality known for his creative approach and making history in the field of education.
                        He is a classic example of courage, commitment and intimate relationship with the corporate
                        world. He still claims to be a student, was a soldier for nearly 28 years, is a trainer, a
                        consultant, an author of five books in management, a writer with more than 100 short stories and
                        two novels to his credit, he is the one who conceived the very idea of creating the first Post

                        Dependents. He is the first Indian from Armed Forces in the history of India to be conferred the

                        Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar were conferred the honorary rank of Lt Col and Group Captain. Thus he
                        has many feathers in his cap and is known for his creative, successful and bold experiments in
                        management education ventures.</p>

                    <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-2">He is an educationist who is clearly ahead of his time and
                        has time and again demonstrated an
                        uncanny ability to foresee the trends of the future within the education industry as well as in

                        and attitude. It is the energy of a nation. It is a source of discipline, dedication and
                        determination to achieve the goal. He keep on saying. He is the founder of the prestigious Sri

                        am proud to record here that more than 1000 students from all these four Management Institutes
                        of Sri Balaji Society have been placed in the Industry by every year with good compensation
                        package. The compensation package varies according to the company and competencies of each
                        individual. This track record has encouraged us to initiate more bold and innovative training
                        methods with active support from the corporate stalwarts and the Industry who have recognized
                        our sincerity and seriousness to the cause of growth and development of our students who are

                        The excellent faculties, conducive environment, good infrastructure and stimulating atmosphere
                        in our campus enable students to dream and work hard to achieve their goals. It should be noted
                        that being creative, experimenting and unconventional group of B-Schools, we keep on updating
                        our course-curriculum and this has increased the efficiency and effectiveness of our students.
                        We treat time as the most precious resource. Therefore, classes-exercises-examinations may be
                        scheduled around the clock, for longer hours, and hence the students are required to go through
                        rigorous and hectic grooming/ training process for 365 days. We don't believe in the concept of
                        holidays as two-years is a short period to impart all the skills and knowledge competencies.
                        Therefore, only those who are medically fit to undergo rigorous and a hectic schedule should
                        seek admission. Positive attitude is the other requisite of our Society.

                        This can be seen from the track record of our campus placements. Our selection process, in the
                        selection centres involves Group Discussions, Essay Writing and Personal Interviews. It may be

                        any of the institutes. We assume that fresh graduates are not well-equipped to know about the
                        job-contents of various courses and therefore, it is our duty to match the candidate to the
                        right course and according to the merit-list.
